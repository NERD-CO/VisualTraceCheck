This is the software pertaining to the study documented in the article: 
"Prior pallidotomy reduces and modifies neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus of Parkinson’s disease patients"

for any questions contact Adam Zaidel adam@alice.nc.huji.ac.il

The software used consists of 2 parts
1) Custom Matlab software (that available here)
2) General Neuroshare Matlab API (information and download is available at: 
http://neuroshare.sourceforge.net/Matlab-Import-Filter/NeuroshareMatlabAPI-2-2.htm)

The custom software consists of 7 files:
1) initialize.m
2) initialize_post.m
3) Calc_SD.m
4) sd_sort_plot.m
5) post_print.m
6) plotAllPSD.m
7) post_print_spectrum.m

Note: Some nomenclature was changed (since programming) for the article, i.e.:
1) SD (standard deviation) used in the software was changed to RMS (Root Mean Square) in the article.
(These terms are interchangeable since the mean is zero)
