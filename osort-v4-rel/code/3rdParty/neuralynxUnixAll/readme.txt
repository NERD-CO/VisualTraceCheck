This directory contains only the 64bit binaries of the Neuralynx libraries for Linux and Mac OS X.
For other versions of unix, older matlab versions, or 32bit versions, the original source needs to be re-compiled. This is not difficult, but requires files not provided here.

How to do this is shown here: http://www.rutishauserlab.org/nxltools
